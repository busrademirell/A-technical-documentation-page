## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- **Adding Fonts (Import via Google Fonts): ->**
  The most common way to add the Inter font to a project is by importing it through the link tag from Google Fonts. The steps for this method are as follows:
  1- Select the desired font from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) library.
  2- Add the link tag provided by Google Fonts to the head section of the HTML file:
  link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"
  3- Apply the font in the CSS file using the font-family property:
  body { font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; }
